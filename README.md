# Welcome to LAB411

In this lab, you’ll work through four hands-on exercises designed to build your skills with Azure and intelligent app development. Below is an overview of each exercise:

1. **Exercise 1** - Get started with intelligent app development by learning to use the Azure OpenAI SDK to call the Chat Completions API, leveraging the GPT-4 model.
  
2. **Exercise 2** - Learn how to integrate the Semantic Kernel into your application to interact seamlessly with Azure OpenAI services.
  
3. **Exercise 3** - Explore the sidecar extensibility feature in Azure App Service. You’ll add an OpenTelemetry (OTEL) sidecar to the app deployed in Exercise 1 for enhanced observability.
  
4. **Exercise 4** - Discover the power and advantages of Small Language Models (SLMs) by building an intelligent app with Phi3 as a sidecar.

To get started, fork this repository to your GitHub account. Detailed instructions for each exercise are available in the `LabInstructions` folder.

Happy learning!
